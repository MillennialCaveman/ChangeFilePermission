### This program is designed to change file permissions remotely. if you are running a large group of computers and need to, for example, change the read/write permissions on msedge you can run this powershell script to do so. 
additionally you can run this on just a single computer. To run on a single computer, swap out "computername" with the name of the machine. If you want to run this on multiple machines, copy line three to the second half of line 1. 
Create a .txt with every computer name (i.e. computername-1...)
First this will run a test to see if the machine is reachable, then it will change the ACL on all available mahines. 
This needs to be run in PS
